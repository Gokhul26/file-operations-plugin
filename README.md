This plugin's main goal is to provide **cross platform** file operations as Build step. 
It also provides the same functionality as [Pipeline](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-aggregator/) step.

No need to search for *Nix or Win commands to do file operations.

1. File **Copy** Operation
2. File **Delete** Operation
3. File **Create** Operation
